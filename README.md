# interjection.sh
Interjection copypasta generator script based on your package manager.

Currently supports `dpkg` and `pacman`. Pull requests are welcome for `portage`, `rpm`, and more!

Inspired by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/comments/6glb85/sorry_stallman/diraclm/) reddit post.

### Usage

`sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://git.io/v7K5W)"`

You might want to pipe the stdout to a clipboard interface like `xclip`.
